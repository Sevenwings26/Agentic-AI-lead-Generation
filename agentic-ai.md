## What is an Agentic AI?

Agentic AI = An autonomous system that can:
- Perceive context (e.g., what the lead wants),
- Reason (e.g., is this a qualified buyer?),
- Act (e.g., send them listings, book a visit, escalate to sales),
- Learn from experience (via feedback loop).

Agentic AI mimic human decision making abilities. 
NLP - Natural Language Processing
